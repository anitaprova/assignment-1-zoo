        Blue whales are the largest animals to have ever existed, 
        reaching a maximum length of 98 ft and weighing up to 199 tons. 
      </br></br>
        They are called blue whales because of their coloring.
        Despite appearing grey on the surface, 
        underwater they appear bright blue due to how light
        interacts with the water.
      </br></br>
        They have big hearts. 
        In fact, the major blood vessel of their heart is so big that a human baby could crawl through it.
