             The Arctic Fox are a species that inhabit both the arctic and alpine tundra. They are known for their thick white fur that allow them to survive in this freezing climate, though a blur fur variant has also been found. This animal measures about 3-3.5 ft with their diet consisting of small mammals such as lemmings and voles. They are hunters of opportunity and have been seen following Polar Bears to reap the leftovers of their hunt.
