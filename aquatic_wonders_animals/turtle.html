				Sea turtles are often associated with tropical regions.
				However, they live in all the world's oceans except for the polar areas. 
				This means that they live in both warm and temperate seas. 
			</br></br>
				Additionally, can they live in coral reefs which provide them 
        shelter, and a reliable food source. But they also give back to the coral reefs in their own way.
        For instance, they graze on sea grass, preventing
        it from overgrowing.
