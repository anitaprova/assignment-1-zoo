				Mandarinfish, also known as mandarin dragonet, 
				is a small, brightly colored member of the dragonet family.
				They are native to the Pacific from the Ryukyu Islands to Australia. 
				The mandarin fish gets its name from  the brightly-colored robes of the Imperial Chinese mandarin.
				<br/><br/>
				They can be shades of blue, orange, green, and yellow.
				Their bright colors actaully deter predators away. Also, instead of scales
				they are covered in mucus that protects their body.
