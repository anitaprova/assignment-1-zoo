            The elephant (Elephas maximus and Loxodonta africana) is the largest land animal on Earth. Elephants are highly intelligent and social creatures. They are herbivores, consuming vast amounts of vegetation each day. Elephants are found primarily in Africa and Asia, where they live in grasslands, forests, and savannas. Their tusks are elongated incisor teeth, and they use them for digging, lifting objects, and defending themselves. These majestic animals are known for their strong family bonds and are often seen in herds led by a matriarch. Despite their size, elephants are gentle giants, exhibiting behaviors such as mourning, playfulness, and cooperation.
