        Sea otters live in coastal marine ecosystems and they live around 15-20 years.
				They are currently endangered due to oil pollution, predation by orcas, and poaching.
				
			</br></br>
				Sea otters obtain their food by diving. They can sense prey using their
        whiskers. They like to eat sea stars, sea urchins, crabs, clams, snail,
        and many other animals.

			</br></br>
			They are highly intelligent and social creatures.
			For instance, they form close bonds with members of their  species.  
			and groups known as rafts or pods when resting or sleeping.
